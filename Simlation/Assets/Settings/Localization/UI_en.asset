      in this scientific survey. This survey is about the evaluation of a prototype
      for the simulation of an ecosystem, with a focus on anthropomorphic climate
      change.\r\n\r\nThis survey is created in the course of writing a master thesis
      at HTWK-Leipzig. The data can be viewed by the supervisor of the scientific
      thesis Prof. Dr. Kiran Varanasi and Mr. Philipp Fanta for the purpose of performance
      evaluation. In accordance with Art. 89 Para. 1 DSGVO, the collected data may
      in principle be stored without restriction.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to information
      by the person responsible for this survey about the collected personal data
      as well as the right to correction, deletion, restriction of the processing
      of the data as well as a right to object to the processing and the right to
      data portability. Before the survey starts, you will see detailed information
      about your rights in the context of this survey and you will be asked again
      for your consent. Your data will be collected and processed exclusively on
      the basis of the legal provisions. Your transmitted data will be encrypted
      and stored on a self-operated server. The transfer itself uses a TLS-1.2 encrypted
      connection. You have the following personal rights in the context of this survey:\r\n\r\n-
      Participation in the survey is optional. You can cancel the survey at any time
      by clicking the button in the upper right corner.\r\n- Your participation is
      anonymous, your answers cannot be traced back to you. This also means that
      your personal data set is not identifiable to me after finishing the survey
      (neither your IP address nor your hardware ID will be processed or stored).\r\n-
      If you want to have information about your data after the study or withdraw
      your participation, I ask you to note this in a comment field (together with
      a contact address if necessary).\r\n- Your data will be used and analyzed exclusively
      for scientific purposes and only in the context of this master thesis.\r\n-
      The research does not follow any commercial interest. Your submitted data will
      be treated strictly private and secure.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about
      this survey, please feel free to contact me, the person responsible for this
      research: Sebastian P\xF6tter (sebastian.poetter@stud.htwk-leipzig.de) a student
      of computer science (INM) at the HTWK-Leipzig, address to contact: Zwenkauerstra\xDFe

      into non-game contexts. The goals of gamification are to increase motivation
      and change behavior among users. Game-typical elements include descriptions,
      goals, participants, rules, opportunities, points, prizes, and comparisons.
      Game-typical processes include the accomplishment of tasks through individual
      or collaborative performance.

      Simulation of an ecosystem means to reproduce processes in nature as realistically
